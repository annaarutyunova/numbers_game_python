# Overview

This is a console game using classes in Python. A sequence of numbers is displayed on the screen, then it disappears and the user is asked to enter the numbers. If the original numbers match the user input, the sequence of numbers + 2 more random random number is displayed to the user again. After it disappears the user is asked to enter the numbers again. The games continutes for as long as the user keeps entering the numbers correctly. 

The purpose of writing this piece of software is to learn how to program in classes in python.

# Future Work

* Learn more about self and use the classes constructors correctly, creating attributes inside the __init__
* The program can be less buggy if it deals with incorrectly typed user input when the user is asked to enter "y/n"
